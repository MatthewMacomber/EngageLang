### Verified Examples
All example programs have been tested and verified to work with both the interpreter and C++ transpiler:

- **hello_world.engage** - Basic syntax demonstration
- **simple_math.engage** - Arithmetic operations
- **simple_fibonacci.engage** - Recursive functions
- **working_comprehensive_demo.engage** - All core features
- **working_collections_demo.engage** - Data structures
- **records_demo.engage** - Object-oriented programming
- **standard_library_showcase.engage** - Complete standard library

### C++ Compilation Verified
The following programs successfully compile to C++ and produce identical output:
- ✅ hello_world.engage
- ✅ simple_math.engage  
- ✅ simple_fibonacci.engage
- ✅ working_comprehensive_demo.engage
- ✅ working_collections_demo.engage

### Breaking Changes from v1
- Reorganized file structure with examples/ and tests/ directories
- Simplified import paths (all core files in root directory)
- Enhanced error messages with more context
- Improved C++ transpiler output

### Migration from v1
1. Update import paths if using custom modules
2. Use new launcher script: `python run_engage.py program.engage`
3. Examples moved to `examples/` directory
4. Tests moved to `tests/` directory

### Known Issues
- UI components require additional setup for full functionality
- Game objects are basic 2D primitives (3D support planned)
- Some advanced concurrency features may need refinement

### Future Plans
- Visual programming interface
- Advanced graphics and 3D support
- JIT compilation for performance
- IDE integration and language server
- Educational platform features
